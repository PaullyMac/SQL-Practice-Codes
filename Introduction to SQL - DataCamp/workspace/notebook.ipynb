You've learned about several advantages of storing data in a database rather than other traditional formats like spreadsheets.\n\nSee if you can remember what they are by selecting all of the advantages.\n![image-4](image-4.png)\n\n__Data organization__\n\nIf you'd like to use SQL to gain insights from data, understanding the organization of a database is an important first step. Take a look at the database below. Which of the following statements correctly describes its organization?\n![image-5](image-5.png)\n![image-8](image-8.png)\n\n__Picking a unique ID__\n\nYou've learned that a unique identifier is a unique value that identifies a record so that it can be distinguished from other records in the same table.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the employees table. Which of the fields do you think is best suited to be a unique identifier?\n![image-12](image-12.png)\n![image-13](image-13.png)\n\n__Setting the table in style__\n\nImagine that you are designing a database and the following table has been suggested. Your task is to provide feedback on how this table could be improved. Use the skills you learned in the last video to critique it!\n![image-15](image-15.png)\n![image-16](image-16.png)\n\n__Our very own table__\n\nWe've set up a database inside this course, and the `books` table is available in the exercise. You'll use SQL to query this table in the next chapter, but for now, it's time to explore what data `books` holds!\n\nYour task is to choose the option below that best describes the information contained in `books`. There's no need to do any coding in this exercise; you can answer this question by looking at the `books` table in the console next to the words \"query result.\" Because some book titles are long, you may need to scroll to the right in order to see all the information that the `books` table contains.\n\n![image-17](image-17.png)\n\n__At your service\n\nNow that you know more about how data is stored, it's time to test those skills!\n\nSelect the statement about database storage that is false.\n![image-20](image-20.png)\n\n__Finding data types__\n\nImagine that you are starting a new job and have just started getting to know your new employer's database. You know that it's important to know the data type—such as `VARCHAR`, `INT`, or `NUMERIC`—corresponding to each field in a table. Where could you find this information?\n\n![image-21](image-21.png)\n\n__Choice of type__\n\nYou've learned that when a table is created, a data type must be indicated for each field. Choosing the correct data type allows the data to be stored correctly and makes certain operations associated with that data type available. For example, mathematical operations can be performed on NUMERIC and INT data types, but not on VARCHAR data. Thus, it makes sense to store numerical values as NUMERIC or INT so that you can perform math operations on them if needed.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll practice selecting the proper data type for your data!\n\nDrag the field description to the bucket indicating the best data type to use for that field.\n\n![image-23](image-23.png)\n\n__SQL strengths__\n\nWhich of the below scenarios describes a situation in which using SQL would be useful?\n![image-24](image-24.png)\n\n__Developing SQL style__\n\nRecall from the video that it's important to pay attention to the formatting of SQL queries in order to make them readable. This is especially helpful as you learn more keywords and your queries get longer.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll review the below query about the patrons table. This code will run properly, but it is messy and hard to read. Your task is to determine which edits are appropriate to improve the query so that it follows best practices for SQL style.\n\n        SELECT CARD_NUM, TOTAL_FINE \n        from patrons\n\nHere's a reminder about what the patrons table looks like!\n![image-25](image-25.png)\n\nDrag each suggestion to the proper zone depending on whether or not it will improve the query's style.\n![image-26](image-26.png)\n\n__Querying the books table__\n\nYou're ready to practice writing your first SQL queries using the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords. Recall from the video that `SELECT` is used to choose the fields that will be included in the result set, while `FROM` is used to pick the table in which the fields are listed.\n\nFeel free to explore `books` in the exercise. Let's zoom in on this table in the database schema to see the fields and data types it contains.\n\nYour task in this exercise is to practice selecting fields from `books.`\n\n1. Use SQL to return a result set of all book titles included in the `books` table.\n-- Return all titles from the books table\n\n        SELECT id, title, author, genre, year\n        FROM books;\n\n2. Select both the `title` and `author` fields from `books.`\n-- Select title and author from the books table\n\n        SELECT title, author\n        FROM books;\n\n3. Select all fields from the `books` table.\n\n-- Select all fields from the books table\n       \n        SELECT *\n        FROM books;\n\n**Making queries DISTINCT**\n\nYou've learned that the `DISTINCT` keyword can be used to return unique values in a field. In this exercise, you'll use this understanding to find out more about the `books` table!\n\nThere are 350 books in the `books` table, representing all of the books that our local library has available for checkout. But how many different authors are represented in these 350 books? The answer is surely less than 350. For example, J.K. Rowling wrote all seven Harry Potter books, so if our library has all Harry Potter books, seven books will be written by J.K Rowling. There are likely many more repeat authors!\n\n1. Write SQL code that returns a result set with just one column listing the unique authors in the `books` table.\n\n-- Select unique authors from the books table\n\n        SELECT DISTINCT author\n        FROM books;\n\n2. Update the code to return the unique `author` and `genre` combinations in the `books` table.\n\n-- Select unique authors and genre combinations from the books table\n\n    SELECT DISTINCT author, genre\n    FROM books;\n    \n**Aliasing**\n\nWhile the default column names in a SQL result set come from the fields they are created from, you've learned that aliasing can be used to rename these result set columns. This can be helpful for clarifying the intent or contents of the column.\n\nYour task in this exercise is to incorporate an alias into one of the SQL queries that you worked with in the previous exercise!\n\n-- Alias author so that it becomes unique_author\n\n    SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author\n    FROM books;\n\n**VIEWing your query**\n\nYou've worked hard to create the below SQL query:\n\n    SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author\n    FROM books;\n    \nWhat if you'd like to be able to refer to it later, or allow others to access and use the results? The best way to do this is by creating a view. Recall that a view is a virtual table: it's very similar to a real table, but rather than the data itself being stored, the query code is stored for later use.\n\n1. Add a single line of code that saves the results of the written query as a view called `library_authors.`\n\n-- Save the results of this query as a view called library_authors\n\n    CREATE VIEW library_authors AS\n    SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author\n    FROM books;\n\n2. Check that the view was created by selecting all columns from `library_authors`.\n\n-- Your code to create the view:\n    \n    CREATE VIEW library_authors AS\n    SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author\n    FROM books;\n\n-- Select all columns from library_authors\n\n    SELECT *\n    FROM library_authors;\n\n**Comparing flavors**\n\nThe video introduced several differences between SQL Server and PostgreSQL. These are just two of many relational database systems available, but the differences are fairly representative of the types of differences you'll see between other SQL database systems and flavors as well.\n\nDrag the statement to the database management system that it correctly describes.\n![image-27](image-27.png)\n\n**Limiting results**\n\nLet's take a look at a few of the genres represented in our library's books.\n\nRecall that limiting results is useful when testing code since result sets can have thousands of results! Queries are often written with a `LIMIT` of just a few records to test out code before selecting thousands of results from the database.\n\nLet's practice with `LIMIT`!\n\nUsing PostgreSQL, select the `genre` field from the `books` table; limit the number of results to 10.\n\n-- Select the first 10 genres from books using PostgreSQL\n\n    SELECT genre\n    FROM books\n    LIMIT 10;\n\n**Translating between flavors**\n\nIn the previous exercise, you wrote the following code using PostgreSQL:\n\n    SELECT genre\n    FROM books\n    LIMIT 10;\n    \nThe database in this course is a PostgreSQL database, so you won't be able to run SQL Server code in any of the exercises. What if you did want to update the above query to work with SQL Server, though? How would you do that?\n![image-29](image-29.png)\n","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"13fba74e-9761-4ddb-bb1b-f1cdeb4aea33"},{"source":"# Congratulations!\n\n- Learned when and why databases are useful\n- Navigated the organization of relational databases\n- Written own SQL queries to extract insight from a database\n\n**Where to go next**\n- Learn more keywords and choose which flavor you'll learn\n\n![image-30](image-30.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6bc25f55-d2f6-4e16-9055-49455753139e"},{"source":"## Explore Datasets\nUse the `books` table to explore the data and practice your skills!\n- Select only the `title` column.\n- Alias the `title` column as `book_title`.\n- Select the distinct author names from the `author` column.\n- Select all records from the table and limit your results to 10.","metadata":{},"id":"05ee1466","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
