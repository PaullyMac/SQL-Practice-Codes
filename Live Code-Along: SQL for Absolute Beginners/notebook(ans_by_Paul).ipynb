Today, we'll be covering the most useful SQL commands — let's start with them one by one. This includes the following:\n\n* `SELECT`: returns either all columns using * or specific columns as specified, seperated by a comma. \n* `FROM` : specifies the table that the data should be returned from. \n* `LIMIT`: limits the number of rows returned.\n* `AS`: lets you set an alias for a particular column \n* `ORDER BY`: returns the data sorted by column specified. Can be sorted in `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending). \n* `WHERE`: lets you filter on a specific column or value\n* `GROUP BY`: lets you aggregate on one or more columns \n* `MAX()`: returns the maximum amount of a particular column \n* `AVG()`: returns the total average of a particular column \n\n### Code Commenting\nThere are two types of code commenting in Postgres\n\n-- `Inline commenting` : Used for quick, short notes \n\n\"/*\" `Multi line commenting` \"*/\" (use without quotation marks): Used for longer comments, such as metadata, or code headers including the author, date, purpose, etc.  \n","metadata":{},"id":"5a74b7b5-b09c-4d0a-a78b-30530683e51d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- SELECT the first 10 rows of all the columns from the airbnb dataset\nSELECT * -- selecting all columns\nFROM 'airbnb_data.csv'-- the airbnb dataset\nLIMIT 10;
